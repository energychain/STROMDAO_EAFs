# About STROMDAO EAF

STROMDAO EAF is a framework built on microservices that enable the efficient implementation of dynamic electricity rates following EAF-10 standards. The services provided are an integration point for the various tasks and use cases that must be considered when introducing dynamic electricity tariffs. STROMDAO EAF acts as a reference implementation, which can either be configured as needed or adapted to the specific requirements of an energy supplier, thanks to its open architecture.
